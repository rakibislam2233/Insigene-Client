Having the peace of mind that your data is being analysed properly and the results presented in a professional, publication-ready format is priceless. We were able to have insightful discussions on how to approach the analysis, and the data reports are easy to follow and very well explained, even for someone without-omics expertise. I hope to continue our ongoing collaboration”</p>
