            INSiGENe BaaS support is available as a monthly subscription. There
            are 2 subscription plans â€“ Pro and Premium. In addition to whole
            team access providing end-to-end support, the Pro plan comes with
            reproducible workflows with results delivered within months for
            typical projects. Premium subscriptions provide the same features as
            Pro plans but with increased bandwidth provided by two dedicated
            data analysts working on your project in parallel for expedited
            turnaround times.
